# Challenge: WikiWriter

Wikipedia thinks it would be awesome if their articles "typed" themselves out over time, instead of all of the text showing up at once. They've hired you to build a prototype for them.

Write a function `wikiWriter` that, when called from the console on any Wikipedia article, clears the article text, and writes it back out to the page one character at a time.
